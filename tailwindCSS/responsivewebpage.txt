Setting Viewport for Responsive Design
The viewport represents the visible area of user's device.
The content that is outside of the viewport can be seen if scrolled.
It helps web pagesâ€™ render well on different devices by controlling the width and scale of the page.

To control the viewport, add the following <meta> tag in the <head> section:
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

The above tag tells the browser to match the page width to the 
screen's width and set the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded by the user.
We can adjust viewport settings for width, initial-scale, maximum-scale, minimum-scale, and user-scalable.
These adjustments can make our website more accessible and user-friendly.
