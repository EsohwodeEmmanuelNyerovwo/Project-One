    Object access chain

When working with objects, we can use the dot notation (also called object access chain) to get the property of an object.


Letâ€™s see an example :


let student = { address: { city: 'New York', country: 'USA' } }



console.log(student.address.city) // New York

console.log(student.address.country) // USA


Use of variable

But when dealing with deeply nested objects, we might end up with a long object access chain.
Naturally, repeating code leads to duplicates and duplicates are a problem. Some even say that duplicates are the most disliked annoyances when it comes to programming. So one of the alternatives is to use variables like we can see below:


let student = { address: { city: 'New York', country: 'USA' } }



let city = student.address.city

let country = student.address.country



console.log(city) // New York

console.log(country) // USA


ES6 Destructuring
Variables solve the issue of redundant code. But, it makes the code longer and harder to read. This is where destructuring comes into play. In simpler terms, the destructuring assignment syntax is a JavaScript expression that makes it possible to unpack values from arrays, or properties from objects, into distinct variables. All we need to do is to put the variable inside two curly brackets in the declaration.

Notice : the variable must have the same name as the property inside the object.

You would do something like this:

let { address } = {address:{city:"New York", country:"USA"}};



let {city, country} = address;



console.log(city) // New York

console.log(country) // USA
     -->
    <script>
        let person = {name:'John', lastName:"Doe",age:28};
        let {name} = person;
        console.log(name);
        // const arr = [1,2,3];
        // const [one,two,th] = arr;
        // console.log(one);
    //     let student = {
    // address: {
    //     city: 'New York',
    //     country:'USA'
    // }
    // }
    // console.log(student.address.city);
    // let {address} = {address:{city:'New York',country:'USA'}};
    // let {city,country} = address;
    // console.log(city);
    // console.log(country);
    </script>
</body>
